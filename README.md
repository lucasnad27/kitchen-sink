kitchen-sink
============

Web app focused on practicing the use of multiple web-based technologies

## Creating a kitchen-sink environment

This app runs using vagrant. Once you have the repository pulled down locally, simply run `vagrant up` and all the necessary startup scripts will run giving you a fully-functional virtual machien that mimics production.

## Running the web app
As this is still just a static website, it is very simple to setup. Make sure you are at the top-level directory of this repository and run `grunt test` to execute all tests. To run a local development server simply run `grunt serve`. Easy as pie!
